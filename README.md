# HS2TakeChargePlugin

This plugin initializes, enables and completes a mostly there framework Illusion had in the game to enable a female take charge mode and an auto play mode.

Usage: Inside a Main Game only HScene, press Ctrl+T (default, rebind in Plugin Settings if desired)...then sit back and watch.

Note:\
When you enable the mode, the female char selects a 'Female Dominate' position from POSITIONS AVAILABLE TO HER. This depends on map and state.
A new girl will have access to few or none of these. If none are available it'll just autoplay-loop on the current scene. 
\
This should only really be used with girls with more advanced experience/state. I don't believe slave girls have access to many dominant positions either, but haven't tested it.\

The Ctrl+A (default) auto mode engages, well, auto mode - similar to above. Game plays itself essentially until you turn it off or the female exhausts. It will randomly select from all available positions, but is limited to Caress, Service and Sex positions (including the Women led versions). Special, Lesbian and Multichar modes will not be selected and enabling auto mode inside of them doesn't entirely function.
