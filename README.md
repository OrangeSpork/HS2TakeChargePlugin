# HS2TakeChargePlugin

This plugin initializes, enables and completes a mostly there framework Illusion had in the game to enable a female take charge mode.

Usage: Inside a Main Game only HScene, press Ctrl+T (default, rebind in Plugin Settings if desired)...then sit back and watch.

Note: When you enable the mode, the female char selects a 'Female Dominate' position from POSITIONS AVAILABLE TO HER. This depends on map and state.\
A new girl will have access to few or none of these. If none are available it'll just autoplay-loop on the current scene. 
\
This should only really be used with girls with more advanced experience/state. I don't believe slave girls have access to many dominant positions either, but haven't tested it.\

The Ctrl+A (default) auto mode engages, well, auto mode - similar to above. Game plays itself, however I think the scene selection is the same as above but I haven't messed with it. I believe the intention is to randomly select from all available positions but I don't think it was fully implemented. TODO on my part.
